## Attender: Simplifying Student Attendance Tracking

Attender is a straightforward web application designed to facilitate student attendance management using QR codes.

### How to Use:
While scanning works best on a mobile device, setting up class lists is more convenient on a computer. Follow these steps:

#### Create QR codes
* Open the website and go to the 'Create QRs' tab.
* Populate the text field with student names or IDs. Easily obtain this information through Moodle by opening the participants page, selecting all, and downloading an Excel spreadsheet.
* Copy the student names from the spreadsheet and paste them into the text area in the 'Create QRs' tab.
* Add a unique class list name and click the 'Generate' button.
The system will generate a zip file containing QR codes for each student. Distribute these codes to the students.

#### Add class lists
Manage class lists on the scanning device, typically a mobile phone. To install the app on your mobile device, visit https://rorywalsh.github.io/attender/ and click the 'install' button. If the install button is not visible, go to File -> Add to Home Screen to install the app on your phone. Use the zip archive with generated QR codes to create a new attendance table in the 'Manage Lists' tab. 

* Upload the file, and it will generate a blank attendance record. There is no limit to the number of classes you can manage.

#### Taking attendance 
To take attendance, go to the 'Scan QRs' tab. Select your class list and the week number, then click the start scanning button. The app will recognize the student's QR code and update the attendance table.
